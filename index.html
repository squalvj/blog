                <p>I’ve work at many different companies i categorize them as, a big company, a huge company, and a small company even tiny.<br>A good company is a group of guys who care of their product and client/targetmarket more than they care about themself, they care about before-sales and after-sales phase, they care about client feelings, they care about ‘what if my client doesnt like this?’, they try to find every client dislikes about their product and fix it as soon as possible, they dont care about how much the income is &amp; how much the outcome are, i seeing a big company are less care about money, they focus on the <strong>User</strong> feelings, their achievement is not about <strong>MONEY</strong> ! they think money will come by the time how good their product is,  a good company will raise the user experience first then they deserve to got income.<br>The problem is, <em>A sailor doesn’t know how to use a compass</em> i see this problem in small company, they dont even know how to sell their product, they dont know how to deal with the after-sales phase, they dont care if user is enjoy their product or not, they only care about <strong>MONEY MONEY AND MONEY</strong>, this disease always infect small company, really brother if you want a lot lot of money please dont think about it that much, you cant got any income if you r not pretend the client is your ‘boss’. Let money become your measure of how good your product is and how much effort that you spend to it, everything has it price, u got nothing if you only care about Money.<br>Another mistake is ‘The Master’ and ‘The Slave’ . There is a big Gap between the high-position employee(i dont know how to spell this) and the low-position-employee, lets call it the wolf and the lamb.<br>The truth is the higher ur position in the company is the more responsibility you have, but this ethical code of being a good employee is gone when u meet someone have the wolf role in the small company. they treat the lamb as their personal assistance, the wolf dont care about the lamb job scope, sometimes the wolf tell the lamb to doing wolf’s job. this is so much wrong, the wolf could hunt the deer alone without ask a favor to the lamb, trust me when u work in a small company, u will doing something that outside your job scope, because the company couldn’t afford extra employee and force the employee to doing extra job with no extra money this is classic company in my country.<br>There are a thousand company you could choose, but it all back again depends how skillful you are, dont get me wrong not all small company is similar likewise i describe, if you feels there is any of your boss doing some wolf and lamb shit, get your ass out of there.</p>

                <p>Can you imagine how easy these day to build anything come to online, i guess it like fliping your hands.<br>So many technology that helps you build even dumb things you could imagine, like this website for example, this website just a proof stupidity i made after my technical blog at <a href="http://www.adityawiraha.com" target="_blank" rel="external">www.adityawiraha.com</a>. I decide to split the technical part and the emotional part into seperate website, and here it comes, this website is just a place for me to blame other,to talk someones <del>disgrace</del> :) ,to spit out the word that i cant spoke in the real world, because facebook is too mainstream. Of course these stupid things is part of learning, to be honest i dont really care is someone reading my post in every blog i had or not, i just love write down everything in my head, its better than <del>masturbate</del> scroll down your facebook timeline over and over again or seeing other’s shit in instagram, this is my <strong>NINJA</strong> way!<br>I guess i can proceed to the next step guys huehuehuehue it’s like the ‘hello world’ in programming :)<br>I decide to write the entire post in english and i’d like to apologize from the bottom of my soul about my grammar, MY ENGLISH SUCKS! i confess that because english is not my first language! yolo</p>
